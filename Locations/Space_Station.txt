You step into the room and feel the artificial gravity kick in, pulling you firmly to the floor. The walls are made of a sleek, metallic material with a slight sheen, giving the room a futuristic and sterile feel. You notice several computer terminals lining the walls, each displaying various readouts and graphs indicating the status of the space station's systems. In the center of the room stands a large cylindrical device, its purpose unclear. The device hums quietly, emitting a soft blue light that illuminates the otherwise dim room. You can hear the faint sound of ventilation fans circulating the air, providing a constant background noise. The room feels claustrophobic, reminding you of the vast emptiness of space just beyond the station walls.
